## Pseudocode
// Pseudocode in Plain English for RPG Game

// Step 1: Start Game
// - Show the start menu
// - Ask the player to choose a reaction: Fight, Flee, or Freeze
// - Store the player's choice and adjust their stats accordingly

// Step 2: Initialize Player Stats Based on Choice
// - If the player chooses Fight:
//   - Disable fleeing
//   - Increase damage by 1.5x when HP is low
// - If the player chooses Flee:
//   - Increase chance of successfully fleeing by 1.5x
// - If the player chooses Freeze:
//   - Reduce flee success rate by 25%
//   - Give player the Freeze ability (stuns both player and enemy for 2 turns)

// Step 3: Start the Game Loop
// - Keep running the game as long as the player is alive
// - Randomly generate enemy encounters
// - Start combat when encountering an enemy

// Step 4: Turn-Based Combat System
// - The player gets to choose an action each turn:
//   - Attack (Choose from different attack options with varying accuracy and damage)
//   - Flee (Check if the player is allowed to flee and calculate flee success based on stats)
//   - Use Item (Access inventory and apply item effects)
// - After the player acts, the enemy takes its turn

// Step 5: Enemy Behavior
// - The enemy loses HP when attacked
// - The enemy can use different abilities based on class
// - If the playerâ€™s HP is below a certain threshold, the enemy may enter Bloodlust Mode:
//   - Only use attack abilities
//   - Attack at 1.25x or 1.5x strength depending on the enemy type

// Step 6: Running from Combat
// - Calculate flee success using player speed vs enemy speed
// - Adjust chance based on the playerâ€™s reaction choice (Fight, Flee, Freeze)
// - If successful, end the battle
// - If unsuccessful, the enemy attacks

// Step 7: Losing and Gaining HP and Mana
// - Player loses HP when attacked
// - Player can regain HP using healing abilities or items
// - Enemy loses HP when attacked
// - Player and enemy can have abilities that restore HP or mana

// Step 8: Victory and Rewards
// - If the enemy's HP reaches 0, the player wins
// - Player gains gold and experience points (if included)
// - Player levels up if enough experience is gained
// - If leveling up, allow the player to allocate stat points

// Step 9: Defeat and Checkpoints
// - If the playerâ€™s HP reaches 0, they lose
// - Restart the game from the last checkpoint (checkpoint = last safe location or level-up point)

// Step 10: Shop System (Stretch Goal)
// - Allow player to enter a shop
// - Display a list of available items
// - Allow the player to purchase items if they have enough gold
// - Add purchased items to inventory

// Step 11: Inventory System
// - Allow player to open inventory
// - Display list of items owned
// - Allow player to use or equip items

// Step 12: Stats Menu
// - Display player stats (HP, mana, attack, defense, etc.)
// - Allow the player to view and manage stats

// Step 13: Leveling Up
// - If the player gains enough experience, level up
// - Prompt the player to choose stats to increase

// Step 14: Boss Fight Availability
// - Once the player reaches a certain level (TBD) and other conditions are met, unlock boss battle

// Step 15: Endgame Options
// - If the player defeats the boss, give them the option to restart or continue playing
