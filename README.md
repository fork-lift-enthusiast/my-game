## Game Description

my game is a turn-based fighting game inspired by classic Pokémon battles, where you—the main character—battle against four generic monsters: a spider, slime, zombie, and wolf. Each monster comes with unique stats and specialized attack moves. you can use punches, kicks, magical fire spells, and potions strategically to defeat each enemy and win the game

## Background

I created Battle Quest to explore basic game mechanics and develop my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I chose the Pokémon-like battle system because it's straightforward, engaging, and allows creative freedom in character and attack design.
